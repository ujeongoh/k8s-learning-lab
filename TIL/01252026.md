# Kubernetes Learning Journey 🚀

**Author:** Joy Oh
**Environment:** macOS (Apple Silicon M3) + Multipass (Ubuntu VMs)
**Tools:** Helm, NFS, ArgoCD, GitOps, Portainer

## Phase 4-5: Package Management & Monitoring

**Goal:** Manage complex Kubernetes applications efficiently using Helm and establish a GUI dashboard.

### 1. Helm (Package Manager)

* **Concept:** Transitioned from managing raw YAML manifests to **Helm Charts**.
* **Configuration:**
* Analyzed `Chart.yaml` and `values.yaml` structures.
* Practiced overriding default settings (e.g., Service type, Replicas) using custom `values.yaml` or `--set` flags.



### 2. Portainer Deployment

* **Setup:** Deployed **Portainer** via Helm to visualize cluster resources (Pods, Namespaces, Volumes).
* **Key Learning:**
* Encountered connectivity issues with `NodePort` in a local VM environment.
* Learned to distinguish between Master Node IPs and Worker Node IPs when accessing services exposed via `NodePort`.

## Phase 6-7: Persistent Storage (Data Persistence)

**Goal:** Solve the ephemeral nature of Pods (data loss on restart) by implementing Persistent Storage.

### 1. PV & PVC Architecture

* **Concept:** Understood the abstraction layer: **PVC** (Request) → **PV** (Resource) → **StorageClass** (Provisioner).
* **Implementation:**
* Set up a **Local NFS Server** on the worker node to simulate shared network storage.
* Installed **NFS Subdir External Provisioner** via Helm to enable **Dynamic Provisioning**.



### 2. Verification

* **Test:**
* Deployed a Pod, wrote a file (`index.html`) to the mounted volume.
* Deleted and recreated the Pod.
* Confirmed the file still existed, validating data persistence across Pod lifecycles.

## Phase 8: GitOps Implementation (ArgoCD)

**Goal:** Build a Continuous Delivery (CD) pipeline where "Git is the Source of Truth," installing components manually ("The Hard Way") to understand the architecture.

### 1. Manual Installation

* **Setup:** Applied official raw manifests instead of Helm to inspect internal components (Repo Server, Dex, Redis).
* **Service Exposure:**
* Patched `argocd-server` from `ClusterIP` to **NodePort**.
* **Troubleshooting (Connectivity):** Fixed a **Protocol Mismatch** where NodePort (30090) was mapped to HTTP (80) instead of HTTPS (443), causing connection refusal.



### 2. GitOps Workflow Verification

* **Pipeline:** Connected a Git repository (Guestbook App) to ArgoCD.
* **Policies:** Enabled **Auto-Sync**, **Prune**, and **Self-Heal**.
* **Drift Detection:**
* **Architecture Issue:** Encountered `exec format error` because the example image was AMD64-only (incompatible with M3 ARM64).
* **Hot-Swap:** Manually changed the live manifest image to `nginx:alpine`.
* **Result:** Verified that ArgoCD flagged the app as **`OutOfSync`**, confirming it correctly detects differences between Git (Blueprint) and Cluster (Reality).
